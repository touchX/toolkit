# Changelog

`sky-toolkit-core` follows [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org) to help manage the impact of releasing new library versions.


## 2.1.0

### Features

* [Node.js] Provide access to a compiled `sky-toolkit-core` stylesheet 
  link—hosted on our CDN—through the entry point. Automatically 
  version-controlled to correspond to your app's version of Toolkit in 
  `package.json`.
  
  For usage information, see [Toolkit's `README.md`](https://github.com/sky-uk/toolkit/blob/master/README.md#hybrid).


## 2.0.0

### Features

* [Colors] `grey-40` modified to meet AA accessibility.
* [Gradients]
    * `@include gradient-background()` refactored to support color stop percentages rather than start and end values.
    * `@include gradient-background()` now supports custom `background-color` fallbacks.
    * `@include gradient-text()` add customisable gradient text fills using the gradients map.
    * `gradient-color-stops()` function to fetch a list of gradient color stop percentages and values.
* [Objects]
    * `.o-list-inline` now aligns with [Supercell](https://github.com/sky-uk/supercell)] modifiers; featuring `--flush`, `--narrow` and `--wide` spacing.
    * `.o-media` now aligns with [Supercell](https://github.com/sky-uk/supercell)] modifiers; featuring `--flush`, `--narrow` and `--wide` spacing.
* [Typography] Updated sizing to the typographic scale.
* [z-index] `z-index()` function for easier access and management of `z-index` values across the project.

### Fixes

* [Generic] Horizontal scrolling bugs caused by full-width (`100vw`) UI elements.

### Dependencies

* [Normalize.css] Major upgrade to Normalize.css from 4.1.1 to 7.0.0. Cursory
  checks show everything is A-okay, but be vigilant—and inexplicable and/or
  subtle rendering issues might be caused by this change.

### Deprecations

* [Gradients]
    * `gradient()` function renamed to `gradient-color()`.
    * Removal of `@include page-background()`, please use:
        * `@include gradient-background(page, horizontal)` instead for the **large** page background gradient, or
        * `@include gradient-background(page-small, horizontal)` instead for the **small** page background gradient.
    * Refactor of `@include gradient-background()`'s `horizontal` option to output the percentages defined, rather than "end start end" values.
    * `large` gradient renamed to `default`.
    * `small` gradient renamed to `highlight`.
    * `mid` gradient renamed to `tile`.
* [Objects]
    * `.o-media--small` renamed to `.o-media--narrow`.
    * `.o-media--large` renamed to `.o-media--wide`.
    * `$container-width` renamed to `$global-container-width`.
* [Typography] Removal of `text-lead-small` and `text-body-small` from `$text`.
    * Please use `text-body` instead.

### Upgrade notes
* [Objects]
    * `.o-list-inline` now adds spacing by default, use the additional `.o-list-inline--flush` modifier to remove spacing.
* [Spacing] Default spacing unit value changed from 30px to 20px.
    * **Variables** - if used in your project, you may want to consider changing the following:
        * `$global-spacing-unit-small` to `$global-spacing-unit`
        * `$global-spacing-unit-tiny` to `$global-spacing-unit-small`
    * **Classes** - if used in your project, you may want to consider changing the following:
        * `.u-margin-all-small` to `.u-margin-all`
        * `.u-margin-top-small` to `.u-margin-top`
        * `.u-margin-right-small` to `.u-margin-right`
        * `.u-margin-bottom-small` to `.u-margin-bottom`
        * `.u-margin-left-small` to `.u-margin-left`
        * `.u-margin-all-tiny` to `.u-margin-all-small`
        * `.u-margin-top-tiny` to `.u-margin-top-small`
        * `.u-margin-right-tiny` to `.u-margin-right-small`
        * `.u-margin-bottom-tiny` to `.u-margin-bottom-small`
        * `.u-margin-left-tiny` to `.u-margin-left-small`
* [Horizontal Scrolling] If your app uses horizontal scrolling, you may need to apply `.u-overflow-x-scroll` to your `<html>` and `<body>` elements.
